        <h3>The Best Hair Tips</h3>
        <h5>Tuck straight hair behind your ears while it air-dries.</h5>
        <p>"I picked up this trick from Harry Josh, the stylist behind Gisele's iconic waves, 
            years ago and haven't looked back. My hair is flat and fine and rarely holds a bend, 
            but doing this makes it air-dry into an easy wave with just the right amount of movement—it 
            doesn't even need any product to stay. It's saved me on countless mornings when I run out 
            of time to do my hair." <quote>—Lindsay Schallon, senior digital beauty editor</quote>

        <h3>The Best Makeup Tips</h3>
        <h5>Dust powder on your eyelids twice to help makeup stay.</h5>
        <p>"I have what very well may be the oiliest lids in the land, and on my hooded eyes, 
            that means even waterproof liner ends up smudged on my crease. I've dubbed it the banana look. 
            I've tried every shadow primer, but the only thing that's made a difference is sweeping on a 
            shadow brush of loose powder before and after I start my eye makeup. 
            It doesn't alter the colors at all, but soaks up oil—and keeps it that way." <quote>—R.N.</quote>

        <h3>The Best Skin Care Tips</h3>
        <h5>Caffeine on your makeup sponge is just crazy enough to work.</h5>
        <p>"I drink a black iced coffee every morning, and sometimes I'll sprinkle a little on my Beautyblender 
            to dampen it while I'm applying foundation. The following claim is obviously self-substantiated, 
            but I swear the caffeinated liquid wakes up my skin and gives me a glow. Whatever works, right?" <quote>—P.S.</quote>
